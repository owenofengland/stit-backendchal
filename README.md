# NYU IT Backend Recruitment

## Overview
"Coding Challenge" for NYU IT Backend Position, built using Python, Flask, and MongoDB

## Installations necessary
flask, flask_pymongo, pymongo
To run just start mongodb, and then "python3 app.py", check functionality in both console and on webpage at the address provided by the console.

## Specifications
Follows the general specifications provided in the document, the api call just prints out the raw data on the console and to the user at this point but I thought dealing with it anymore was beyond the scope of the exercise, and I was running out of time to work on this with my other commitments.
